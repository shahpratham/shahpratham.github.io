I am a final year undergraduate student at [Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Mumbai](https://vjti.ac.in/) pursuing my B. Tech in Information Technology. Currently, I am undertaking my thesis project at NTU Singapore at SpeechLab under Prof. Dr. Chng Eng Siong.

My research interests include:
1. Natural language Understanding
2. Multilingual Semantics
3. Applications of Deep learning
4. Object Tracking

I am always eager to collaborate on projects related to NLP and Computer Vision.
