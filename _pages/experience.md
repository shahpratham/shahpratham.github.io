Research experience
======
* <ins>**Research Intern @ Speechlab, NTU Singapore** (Summer 2023 & Fall 2023)</ins> \
  _Dr. Chng Eng Siong_
  * Developing a pipeline to facilitate code-switch (English-Malay) text generation for NER task.
  * Using Self-Bleu to access the quality of prompts and multi-lingual BERTScore to filter out good quality code-switch candidates.
  * Replicating the approach for low-resource languages, demonstrating adeptness in cross-lingual NLP strategies.
  * **Domain**: NLP, Codeswitching, text generation

* <ins>**Research Intern @ CFILT Lab, IIT Bombay** (Winter 2022 & Spring 2023)</ins> \
  _Dr. Puspak Bhattacharya_ 
  * Researched an automated method for linking multilingual Indo-Wordnet using sense embeddings.
  * Incorporated One-to-One and translation-based filtering techniques to optimize candidate search space, achieving top-k similar synset retrieval efficiency in wordnets.
  * Submitted results and findings at LREC-Coling 2024 – The 2024 Joint International Conference. 
  * **Domain**: NLP, Multi-lingual semantics, Sense embeddings

Work experience
======
* <ins>**SAP Labs India** (Jun 2023 - Aug 2023)</ins> \
  `Software Developer Intern | Banglore, India` \
  <!-- _Manager: Mr. Ramu Gowda and Mr. Suman De_ -->
  * Migrated code from SAP UI5 to React framework of OneSAP Portal, an application designed to enable customer success solutions.
  * Integrated components required for ticket-raising and live attachments functionality within the application.
  * **Skills**: React, SAP Cloud Application Programming Model, SAP UI5, OData Services


* <ins>**Google Summer of Code at Forschungszentrum Jülich** (May 2022 - Sep 2022)</ins> \
  `Open Source Developer | Remote` \
  <!-- _Mentor: Dr. Claudia Comito_ -->
  * Custom method was devised to parallelize 1D and 2D fully-distributed convolutions. APIs for both implementations are consistent with other mainstream libraries and provide appropriate functionality.
  * Performance was improved by adopting MPI collective communication (Bcast) instead of point-to-point non-blocking communication (Isend and Irecv) among the processes.
  * **Skills**: PyTorch, Parallel Algorithms, Convolution, MPI
