### Abstract

WordNet is a lexical database of English words that groups them into sets of synonyms called synsets and provides
information about the relationships between these synsets. Multilingual WordNets are lexical databases that
extend the WordNet concept to multiple languages. They are organized in a similar way as WordNet, with sets
of synonyms and relationships between them. Linking between multilingual WordNets is important for several
reasons. It can aid in cross-lingual information retrieval, machine translation, and language learning. It also helps
to identify relationships between concepts in different languages and facilitates the development of multilingual NLP
systems. In this paper, we present our efforts to automate the process of linking IndoWordNet(Wordnet for Indian
languages) with English WordNet. Main purpose behind presenting this automatic linking approach is to reduce the
manual labour work done to link the Indian language synsets with English Wordnet. We propose two approaches
based on the synset embedding and finding the best similar synset by one to all and filtering via translation method,
the metric used for correlation between synset embeddings is cosine similarity. Additionally, we introduce a novel
methodology for linking transitive words. Our results are evaluated and discussed to showcase the effectiveness of
our proposed methods.
